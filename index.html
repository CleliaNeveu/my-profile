	<p> 
	I am a 5th year student at ESSEC Business Schoolüéì and I am also in apprenticeship at Hertz Franceüöô as a junior product manager. I love <strong>travelling‚úàÔ∏è</strong> and I have always been attracted to the <strong>social‚õëÔ∏è and humanitarian sectorüåè</strong>.

		<h2>My trips‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
		<p>
		With a mother from Portugal and a father with Greek origins, since I was born, I have always been used to travel. Added to this family cocoon rich in diversity, my godfather is Vietnamese and has been living for a few years.
		in Australia, my godmother lives in Ireland, my uncle in the Netherlands and my best friend is of Malian origin. So I was rocked in all this multicultural atmosphere in which I grew up and travelled.
		Curious of discoveries since I was 12 years old, I had the chance to go every summer to summer camps where I could make various tours throughout Europe by travelling through different countries: Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary and Malta. 
		In addition, thanks to the academic exchange included in our ESSEC course in semester 7, I had the chance to study for 6 months in a completely new environment for me, which is Singapore. At the same time, I was able to visit many Asian countries such as Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Australia.
		You will find below an overview of these trips:

		<h2>My volunteering involvement‚õëÔ∏è</h2>
			<p>This feeling of being useful by helping others is one of the greatest satisfactions for me. For example, I often give my blood through the French blood donation establishment (4 times a year) and I also often take part in charity races where distances are different (I runned from 5 kms to an half marathon in Singapore) and the funds collected are donated to various associations like UNICEF, Action contre la faim, Odyssea,  for different causes like  the fight against breast cancer, mucoviscidosis, world hunger and education for all.
			During the confinement in April when we were all at home, I decided to get more involved by using my free time to help the most needy. So, I searched for voluntary work on the net and I found that the values of the Red Cross corresponded to mine (humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independance, voluntary service, unity, and universality) that's how I joined the association. I just wanted to share with you my most memorable mission with few words and few pictures. 
			As a result of this unprecedented pandemic situation, many households can no longer afford to eat normally. One in three families is reduced to eat just one meal a day.
			In response to this crisis, the French Red Cross has stepped up its food distribution activities. Every week, mainly canned food, is distributed. 
			To innovate, the association has launched a challenge called <strong>#CroixRougeFamily</strong>. It's the crazy idea of delivering to the homes of all the beneficiaries in the Val d'Oise department, a hot meal that is good for the body and heart! 
			For 2 whole days, a hundred volunteers were mobilised. One day was only dedicated to the preparation of 800 hot meals (a couscous prepared by us). From 8am until 2am we stayed in the kitchen of a chocolate factory which welcomed us to cook all the ingredients, put them in trays and label them. And you know what? The fun fact was that this day I spent 16 hours of intense work with people I didn't know before, on my birthday.The second day was spent delivering all these meals to the beneficiaries' homes. It was together in two sleepless days that we managed to create the feat we had been dreaming of: Distributing 750 meals & smiles to the 4 corners of the Val d'Oise. A birthday I will never forget. We even appeared in the newspapers and on TV, so if you want to see the result in video it's here:
